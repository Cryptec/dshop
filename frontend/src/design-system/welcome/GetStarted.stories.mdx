# ðŸ‘‹ Get Started

Welcome to the design system documentation. This is the core of any user interface you will design or create. It serves the purpose to seperate ui and business logic entirely (or at least as much as we can) to keep scope and complexity of the actual frontend implementation as easy and simple as we can.

## Storybook

This storybook is your single source of truth for UI components, it makes the API discoverable and as simple as a copy paste.

> Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.
