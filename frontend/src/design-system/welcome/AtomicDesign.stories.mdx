# ðŸ’« Atomic Design

We follow the principals of Atomic Design to strucutre our component's hierarchy. Bad Frost explains better than anyone why Atomic Design doesso much sense. Here's a short introduction to the five levels of hierarchy - read more [here](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

## **ðŸ’§ Atoms**

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

## **ðŸŒ± Molecules**

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

## **ðŸŒ³ Organisms**

Molecules give us some building blocks to work with, and we can now combine them together to form organisms. Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

## **ðŸ“ƒ Templates**

At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to our clients and our final output. Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.

## **ðŸ“˜ Pages**

Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.
